# Fay::Rails

Combos Haskell Fay into rails asset pipeline so you can write javascript in haskell.

If this isn't working, you probably don't have fay and fay-base installed. Run the following:

```shell
cabal install fay fay-base
```

to download the fay command line tool (which is used in here to compile).

If you're having trouble with it, please consult the [fay-lang wiki](https://github.com/faylang/fay/wiki)

Note you must have haskell installed on your computer.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'fay-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fay-rails
